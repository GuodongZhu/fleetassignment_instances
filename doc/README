These fleet assignment instances come under a json format. As a
specification of this json format, a small example is provided for each of
the instance types. Reading these example should probably be enough to
understand the formats.

In case you are not familiar with json, you should have a look at
http://json.org/. It is very simple!

As an example, here is how to read a json document in python2:

from __future__ import with_statement
import json
with open("my_json_file") as f:
    instance = json.load(f)

Your instance is now loaded as a dictionary. You can access any of its
fields easily.

print f["network"]

There are plenty of json libraries in every languages...
